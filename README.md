### Deliverables
* A repo containing create-react-app project:
* Three react components in your App.js:
```
class ImageForm extends Component(
  render() {
    return(
      <form>
        ...
      </form>
    )
  }
);
class ImageList extends Component(
  render() {
    return(
      <ul>
        ...
      </ul>
    )
  }
);
class ImageBoard extends Component(
  render() {
    return(
      <div>
        <ImageForm />
        <ImageList />
      </div>
    )
  }
)
```
## I'M A WEB DEVELOPER MODE
Using the tools you've learned in class, create a responsive image board that allows you to add images and captions via a url. The images that are added to the image board should be saved using React state. Below are screenshots of what your app could look like. But feel free to use some creative freedom.

## Hey Mikey, I Think He Likes It Mode
- The form to add an image should properly validate the image URL by at minimum
  checking for a http:// or https:// prefix and require a non-empty description.
